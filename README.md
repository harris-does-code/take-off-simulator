Project: Plane Takeoff Simulator
Last date edited: 3/11/2024

This program will simulate the flight of a fighter jet and a cargo plane.
The user will enter a 'y' or 'n' to indicate if the plane is ready for
takeoff. If 'n', the plane will not takeoff, but the program will wait for 
several seconds before asking again if the plane is ready. If 'y', the 
plane will takeoff, fly, and then land.
